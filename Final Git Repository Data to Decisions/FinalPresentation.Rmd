This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r library}

library(ggplot2)

### RQ Rhonda

Of the clients receiving services that identified as Hispanic or
Mexican, how many received services at which branch

### Dataset Used

```{r HFS}
    HFS<-read.csv("HFS.csv")
View(HFS)
```
```{r Cleaned}
HFS.Cleaned<-HFS[c(4,9,25,30,46,49)]
names(HFS.Cleaned)
```

```{r Changed to Latino}
HFS.Ethnicity2 = HFS.Cleaned[HFS.Cleaned$ethnic_identity != "Not Collected",]
HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity[HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity== "Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino"]<- "Not Latino"
HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity[HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity== "Mexican"]<- "Latino"

HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity[HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity== "Other Hispanic or Latino"]<- "Latino"


HFS.Ethnicity2 = HFS.Ethnicity2[HFS.Ethnicity2$ethnic_identity !="Unknown",]

count(HFS.Ethnicity2, ethnic_identity)
```



## RQ 3

The data cleaning results in a new subset of 5 variables based on the
attributes analyzed in the first research question. Important columns
within this data cleaning are listed below: program_unit_desc
ethnic_identity age facility program_type

This BoxPlot identifies that most Latinos receive services for Mental
Health Programs and are between the ages of 18 and 50.

``` {r Box Plot}
ggplot(HFS.Ethnicity2) +
  aes(x = program_unit_description, y = age, fill = ethnic_identity) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.5, lwd=1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  ylab("Age") + xlab("Program Unit")+
  labs(fill = "Ethnicity") +
  labs (title = "Ethnicity by Age & Program Unit") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

  ##Bar chart of Ethnicity & Facility
  
  This BarChart shows us that the majority of Latinos served attend the
North Omaha Campus and the Heartland Family Service-Central location.

```{r Bar Chart}
ggplot(HFS.Ethnicity2) +
  aes(x = facility, fill = ethnic_identity)+
  labs(fill = "Ethnicity")+
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_hue(direction = 1) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 9L))
```
