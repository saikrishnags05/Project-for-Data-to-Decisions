## Introduction
Heartland Family Service, which was founded in Omaha in 1875, served more than 79,000 individuals and families last year through direct services, education, and outreach from more than 15 facilities in east central Nebraska and southwest Iowa. In the following focus areas, our programs provide important human services to children, individuals, and families:

•	Housing, Safety, and Financial Stability 

•	Child & Family Well-Being 

•	Counseling & Prevention

Staff can hand-craft an integrated, multi-service, trauma-informed strategy to help clients toward safety, well-being, and, ultimately, self-sufficiency, thanks to their programs and services. A sliding pricing scale is available for some of their counseling services.

Heartland Family Service's objective is to enhance communities by providing education, counseling, and support services to individuals and families. Last year, Heartland Family Service, which was founded in Omaha in 1875, served 60,309 individuals and families through direct services, education, and outreach from more than 15 locations in east central Nebraska and southwest Iowa. In the following target areas:
Child & Family Well-Being, Counseling & Prevention, and Housing, Safety, & Financial Stability,their programs provide important human services to the individuals and families that ultimately create the future of our community.


# Cleaning Process

### Rearch Questions Over View:
#### RQ 1


**My Research Question is to tell that how much time of delay it take to takes for enrolling into the event, Entering into system and Approving the enrollment.** **(Sai Krishna)**

Reason:-
This will help in analyzing the time taking per enrolling from starting to ending state. And what kind of people are enrolling on the day of the even or before the event and total time taken for individual event.
This will help the HFS to improve the speed of enrollment and also can increate the event of that type in that location.

### Data cleaning:

I have created a new data set based on attributes that I choice from Dataset to analyze my desired Research Question. Attributes are mentioned bellow.

`facility`, `actual_date`, `event_name`, `date_entered`, `approved_date`, `program_unit_description`, `zip`, `state`,`ethnic_identity`

#### In the new data set there 3  variables that talks about the dates in numeric form.

`actual_date` is about the actual data of the program admission.

`date_entered` is about when was the service entered (days after enrollment or days before enrollment)

`approved_date` is about when was the service documentation approved by a supervisor? (Days after enrollment)

#### Other Attributes:

`event_name`  is about the name of the event.

`program_unit_description`  is about the event description

`zip`	Zip of the location

`state`	Which location is the 

`ethnic_identity` this is about the people of different groups who attend the events 

### Cleaning procidure :- 

 **step 1:-** Since i am using Data format so i have to find the difference between each and every even that is been taken place. So, i have used as.Date() function to get the actual date format.
 
 **step 2:-** Apply step1 to all the date column to verify it in next phase.
 
 **step 3:-** Now create a new column add subtract the dates if we get the values in negatives then it is enroled before the event,if 0 then they resisted at the moment and if greater the 0 then it is  after the event.
 
 **step 4:-** Later total we have 5 states in the data set which is mentioned in short form
 
 **step 5:-** Subset each and every State are in short form like `IA`,`NE`,`CO`,`NC`,`SC`and later updated to full form of user understanding `iowa`, `Nebrska`        `colorado`, `north carolina`,`south carolina`

 and we can observe many different plots based on state and there zip code.
```{r}
HFS_data<-read.csv("HFS Service Data.csv")
#before cleasing the Na values
#head(HFS_data)
```
Libraries used
```{r}
library('ggplot2')
#library('')
```

As the Information for the sources of the data that is fatched out to csv on **25th August 2021**.

By using this date i have created  original data of the events. with the help of **as.Date()** function in R

```{r}
HFS_data$AD<-as.Date(-(HFS_data$actual_date), origin = '2021-08-25')
HFS_data$ED<-as.Date(-(HFS_data$date_entered), origin = '2021-08-25')
HFS_data$Date_of_approved_date<-as.Date(-(HFS_data$approved_date), origin = '2021-08-25')

HFS_data$AD_1<-(HFS_data$actual_date-HFS_data$date_entered)
#str(HFS_data)
```

### Cleaning State Names:

We have a total of five states

```{r}
regions<-c(unique(HFS_data$state))
regions
```
Now we update all the states name into full form and them into the dataset for easy understanding.
```{r}
HFS_data$state<- as.character(HFS_data$state)
HFS_data$state[HFS_data$state == "NE"] <- "nebrska"
HFS_data$state[HFS_data$state == "IA"] <- "iowa"
HFS_data$state[HFS_data$state == "SC"] <- "south carolina"
HFS_data$state[HFS_data$state == "NC"] <- "north carolina"
HFS_data$state[HFS_data$state == "CO"] <- "colorado"
```

After Changing the Short form of the state:-
```{r}
c(unique(HFS_data$state))
```

# Speliting the individual data accoring to the region:-

# IA(iowa):
```{r warning=FALSE}
IA<- subset(HFS_data,state=='iowa')
#str(IA)
p <- ggplot(data = IA, aes(y =IA$AD, x =IA$AD_1,color=ethnic_identity ))
p + geom_point()+geom_violin() +facet_wrap(IA$zip~IA$program_name,scales='free')
```
In the above graph you can understand that most of the people who from Iowa joining events  are **Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino** most of them are opting Gambling where as other ethnic_identity groups are attending the events like **Mental Health** and **Substance Use** and most of them are from Zip code 0.
### NE(nebraska)
```{r warning=FALSE}
NE<- subset(HFS_data,state=='nebrska')
#head(NE)
p <- ggplot(data = NE, aes(y =NE$AD, x =NE$AD_1,color=ethnic_identity ))
p + geom_point() +geom_violin()+facet_wrap(zip~program_name,scales='free')
```
In this graph we can under stand how the date 
### CO(colorado)
```{r warning=FALSE}
CO<- subset(HFS_data,state=='colorado')
#head(CO)
p <- ggplot(data = CO, aes(y =CO$AD, x =CO$AD_1,color=ethnic_identity ))
p + geom_point() +geom_violin()+facet_wrap(~zip,scales='free')
```

### NC(north carolina)
```{r warning=FALSE}
NC<- subset(HFS_data,state=='north carolina')
#head(NC)
p <- ggplot(data = NC, aes(y =NC$AD, x =NC$AD_1,color=ethnic_identity ))
p + geom_point() +geom_violin()+facet_wrap(~zip,scales='free')
```

### SC(south carolina)
```{r warning=FALSE}
SC<- subset(HFS_data,state=='south carolina')
#head(SC)
p <- ggplot(data = SC, aes(y =SC$AD, x =SC$AD_1,color=ethnic_identity ))
p + geom_point() +geom_violin()+facet_wrap(~zip,scales='free')
```

## RQ 2

### Job Position, Ethnicity, Location, and Dropped Appointments (Chad Crowe)

### RQ Overview

The third research question concerns exploring the job role of therapists within HFS, with specific interest in appointment no shows. When patients fail to appear for appointments, this costs HFS time and costs the patient opportunity for therapy. We explore whether there exist clear patterns that might contribute to patients missing visits, such as a location or ethnicity effect. It might be the case that particular facilities are less friendly in supporting a language, which might effect the rate of dropped appointments. 

The research also explores whether job title effects dropped appointments. Job requirements might change from title to title that might have an effect on dropped appointments. This research explores the phenomenon. 

Initial research also explores appointment duration.  Based on the given data, it is unknown whether appointment duration is fixed by insurance or varies between patients. This research explores duration of appointments across job position, ethnicity, location, and the rate of dropped appointments too. While success is not determined by duration, Dr. Juarez mentioned how HFS is very interested in exploring patterns pertaining to the number of appointments and durations by each patient since it affects the funding HFS receives. 

### Datasets Used

The data explored in this research question include five columns:

- Job Title (Therapists I, II, and III)

- Ethnicity

- Facility Location

- Appointment Duration

- Appointment No Shows

Each column will be explored in the following section. The section will describe the number of rows & columns and provide sample headers. The section will also include a description of the metadata, such as what information is available for understanding and interpreting the data. The section will also cover the rationale for remediating and cleaning the data, such as handling empty data. It will also include a description of the approach and the code required for replication.

### Description of Datasets

#### Job Title (Therapists I, II, and III)

```{r classwork}
library('dplyr')
library('tidyverse')
library('moderndive')
#data <- read.csv("/Users/ccrowe/github/isqa8600_ChadCrowe/programs/data/HFS Service Data.csv")
data <- read.csv("HFS Service Data.csv")

```
The data contains `r nrow(data)` rows. If we filter out NA values for job title there are `r nrow(as_tibble(data) %>% drop_na(job_title))`. This means each row has a job title and there are no NA values. Given that there is no missing data, there is no need to handle missing data. 

Below is a plot of available job titles:
```{r job_title_all}
tibble_data <- as_tibble(data)
# data header
head(tibble_data$job_title)
job_title_counts <- tibble_data %>% group_by(job_title) %>% count(sort=TRUE)
ggplot(job_title_counts) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = reorder(job_title,-n), y = n)) +
ggtitle("Count of Rows for each Job Title") +
xlab("Job Title") +
ylab("Count of Job Title's Occurrence") +
 #ylim(0, 130) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), legend.position = "none")
```

Most job titles have fewer than fifty instances. Job titles with many instances include therapist, clinical supervisor, case managers, and admin assists. Of those job titles, there are five types of therapists. Given most of the primary job titles are therapists, the exploration of job titles will focus on therapists. We filter the job titles to the various therapist job positions.

```{r filter_for_therapists}
therapists = data %>% filter(data$job_title == "THERAPIST I" | data$job_title == "THERAPIST II" | data$job_title == "THERAPIST III" | data$job_title == "LEAD THERAPIST" | data$job_title == "Therapist")
```

If we filter out therapists there are only `r nrow(therapists)` rows, so 1500 fewer rows. 

#### Ethnicity

```{r ethnicity_breakdown}
tibble_data <- as_tibble(data)
ethnicity <- tibble_data %>% group_by(ethnic_identity) %>% count(sort=TRUE)
# data header
head(tibble_data$ethnic_identity)

```

There are no NAs for the ethnic_identity column. The ethnic identities are categorized as Mexian, Hispanic/Latino, and not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino. Ninety-percent of the data (7820 rows) are not Spanish, Hispanic or Latino. The following plot shows the diparity of counts within the ethic_identity column.

```{r ethnic_plot}
ggplot(ethnicity) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = reorder(ethnic_identity,-n), y = n)) +
ggtitle("Count of Rows for each Ethnicity") +
xlab("Ethnicity") +
ylab("Count of Ethnicity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), legend.position = "none")
```

Given that most categories have fewer than two-hundred persons, one simlification is to create a binary column for Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino and Spanish/Hispanic/Lantino.  We'll filter out unknown since it contains no ethnic identity information. Otherwise, there are no NAs or missing data in this column so there's no need to handle or filter out NAs.

```{r two_ethnicities}
two_ethnicities <- tibble_data %>% mutate(is_minority = ethnic_identity != "Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino") %>% filter(ethnic_identity != "Unknown")
two_ethnicities %>% group_by(is_minority) %>% count()
```

When we filter by the identified ethinicities and filter out the unknown category we get almost 800 rows of ethnicities HFS tracks. 


#### Facility Location

Below we can see a breakdown of records per facility.  We group by facility and sort by the facilities with the most usage. This will help us understand the usage of HFS facilities within the dataset.

```{r facility_breakdown}
tibble_data <- as_tibble(data)
# data header
head(tibble_data$facility)
grouped_facility <- tibble_data %>% group_by(facility) %>% count(sort=TRUE)
#ordered <- transform(grouped_facility, variable=reorder(facility, n) ) 
ggplot(grouped_facility) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = reorder(facility,-n), y = n)) +
ggtitle("Count of Records by Facility") +
xlab("Facility") +
ylab("Count of Records at a Facility") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), legend.position = "none")
# check for NAs
tibble_data %>% filter(facility == NA) %>% count()
```

From the graph we see nine main facilities with more than two-hundred records. There are three facilities with more than one-thousand rows. We want to avoid aggregating smaller facilities together since each facility might be very different.  For now, we will leave the smaller facilities in the data.  Later on, we might remove facilities with very few users. No rows are NA so there is no need to handle NAs or missing data in this column. 

#### Appointment No Shows

The column is_noshow is interesting because these are costly events for both HFS and for the potential benefactor. No_shows consume HFS appointment time and the person loses out on an opportunity for therapy. 

```{r noshow_breakdown}
tibble_data <- as_tibble(data)
# data header
head(tibble_data$is_noshow)
grouped_no_show <- tibble_data %>% group_by(is_noshow) %>% count(sort=TRUE)
ggplot(grouped_no_show) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = reorder(is_noshow,-n), y = n)) +
ggtitle("Count of Rows for Show vs NoShow") +
xlab("Appointment Show or No Show") +
ylab("Count of Category") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1), legend.position = "none")
# check for NAs
tibble_data %>% filter(is_noshow == NA) %>% count()
```

We see that 15% of all rows are no shows. 15% seems like a surprisingly high number of appointment no shows for any organization. This metric is worth looking into further. There are no NAs in the column or values we want to filter.

### Number of Appointments per Person

HFS has voiced an interest in the number of appointments and total duration spent per patient. While duration length or the number of appointments does not connotate to organizational success, they are metrics that HFS reports to funders. 

```{r appointments}
tibble_data <- as_tibble(data)
# data header
head(tibble_data$recordID)
record_counts <- tibble_data %>% group_by(recordID) %>% count(sort=TRUE) %>% filter(n > 2)
ggplot(record_counts) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = reorder(recordID,-n), y = n)) +
ggtitle("Plot of Repeated Record Count per Person") +
xlab("Person's RecordId") +
ylab("Count of Person's Appointments") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

There are only 460 records with more than one appointment with HFS, which is only 5% of all HFS records. From this we learn that almost all appointments are single-time appointments. Considering the few number of records with multiple appointments, it might not be worth looking further into the factors affecting duration or the number of appointments.

1. **One scatter plot with three variables, properly labeled; choose your representation of the third variable based on what’s best for representing the data.**  
* Three used variables are:
  * ethnic_identity
  * facility  
  * Adding a third variable in geom point using color=program_name 
```{r}
ggplot(data = HFS.Ethnic_identity.cleaned, aes(x =ethnic_identity , y =program_unit_description , colour=program_name)) +geom_point(size = 3)+
     labs(title = "Scatter plot with three variables", y = "Unit Description of the Program", x = "Ethnicity")+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
[](https://github.com/saikrishnags05/Project-for-Data-to-Decisions/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning%20Documentation/GIT_Data-Cleaning_files/figure-gfm/Scatter_Plot.jpeg)
The above scatter plot is composed of three variables: ethnic_identity, program_unit description and program_name. from this plot , we can say that people have mostly participated in the mental health program. The second major program is for the substance use program. The plot also describes that NON HISPANIC clients are most likely  to be treated in the programs.

2. **One faceted plot of two variables, properly labeled.**  
* Two used variables are:
  * ethnic_identity
  * facility 
   
  | [Faceted Chart](https://github.com/saikrishnags05/Project-for-Data-to-Decisions/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning%20Documentation/GIT_Data-Cleaning_files/figure-gfm/Faceted.jpeg)
| -
ggplot(data = HFS.Ethnic_Identity.cleaned, aes(ethnic_identity,facility)) +
+     geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
+     geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
+     labs(title = "Faceted plot of two variables Ethnic Identity vs Facility", x = "ethnic_identity", y = "facility") +
+     facet_wrap(.~program_name)


I have divided the plot using the ethnic_identity of the clients. This plot uses two variables Ethnic Identity and Facility. We can say from the plot that due to uncollected data or unknown/missing values there are more separations in the plot. However , with the data in hand, the created plot shows the differences of programs being served from the various facilities accross various ethnicities.

3. **One bar chart, properly labeled.**  
* Used variable is:
  * ethnic Identity  
```{r}
ggplot(data = HFS.Ethnic_Identity.cleaned)+
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=ethnic_identity),colour="white",fill="blue")+
    labs(title = "One bar chart of Ethnic Identity", y = "Count of Clients of Each Ethnicity", x = "Client Ethnicity")
```
| ![Bar Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saikrishnags05/Project-for-Data-to-Decisions/master/Data%20Cleaning%20Documentation/GIT_Data-Cleaning_files/figure-gfm/Bar_Chart.jpeg)
| -
This Bar chart is composed of only the Ethnicity of the Client of HFS. It shows how many clients are in each ethnicity group. The charts shows that most clients of HFS are Not Latino. Also we can observe that out of almost 8000 clients approximately 400 clients are Other Latino or Unknown 


# Thing explored:
We have explored many different types of attributes that are required to solve the 3 research questions and also we analysed the data that we have now can also get other results.Further We can subset each and every Character data and get additional information.

# Results
All the Data is perfectly cleaned and analysed. We can get clear and beautiful plots or results from the cleaned data.
