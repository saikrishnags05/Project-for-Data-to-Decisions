# Instructions (REMOVE ME)
Brief but descriptive Readme.md that includes a license for your work, the names of the team members, and an overview of package contents, along with a paragraph describing each person's contributions to the individual deliverables for the entire project (who did what), which should be fairly consistent with Git version history, and the proofreaders’ sign-off statement.

## Project Work Plan

Chad, Sai and Rhonda each contributed to the project plan. Sai created the repository, Chad created the project plan timeline, and Rhonda proofread.

## Research Questions

Each of us split up the research question.  Chad worked on the first research question, Sai the second, and Rhonda the third. Rhonda proofread.

## Data Cleaning Documentation

Each of us worked on the data cleaning documentation for our research question.  Sai worked on the first question, Chad the second, and Rhonda on the third.  Rhond proofread.

## R Script

Chad, Sai and Rhonda each contributed to the project plan. Sai worked on Research Question 1 Chad worked on Research Question 2 Rhonda worked on Research Question 3 Chad proofread

The entire group is performing data exploration concerning location and its relationship to other columns, such as the onboarding duration, ethnicity, program name, and job title. Given this general direction of interest, each of us explored a related research question. Fortunately, based on the data exploration documentation, we are updating the direction of our research. Specifically, how does onboarding duration change when enhanced by interesting findings concerning ethnicity, program name, and job title. Part of the progress demonstrated by this assignment intertwines these aspects.

## R Plots

Chad, Sai and Rhonda each contributed to the project plan. Sai worked on Research Question 1 Chad worked on Research Question 2 Rhonda worked on Research Question 3 Rhonda proofread

Each person went ahead and readdressed their research question from the initial “Research Questions” assignment. Secondly, each person chose a particularly informative plot that best-fit or best-explained the exploration and analysis of their research question. Thirdly, each person provided their own explanation of their plot in one or two paragraphs. Chad combined the work of all three team persons and also performed the proofreading.

## Project Presentation

Chad put together the structure for the slides. Chad and Sai decided on a final structure and presentation format. Rhonda added her slides in the relevant aspects of the presentation since she was sick and out of class. Chad did the design for the presentation. Rhonda proofread the slides.

## Git Repository Package

Sai Krishna :
Read all the R-codes in the group tasks and verify  whether the code is working  together or not and rectify the issues if any and link the plots to the respective plot scripts and submit them into GitHub and commit them and I forward the next task to Chad. He verified  all the details which are  present in the file. whether they are in proper order or not and proofread it and submit it once again.

Chad:
Chad proofread the written summary. Rhonda proofread the presentation slides.

Rhonda:
In Github, I revised the code to reflect the suggested changes from the peer review to the graphs for question 3 and linked the new plot to the plot script.  I proofread the presentation slides.

# Proofreader's Sign-off Statement

Chad proofread the Slides and Rhonda proofread the written summary.
